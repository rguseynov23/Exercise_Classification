# Exercise_Multinomial_Classification
The purpose of this analysis is to build a model that will tell a user whether they are performing an exercise correctly, or whether they are making one of four common errors. The dataset was collected from sensors worn by participants performing a bicep curl exercise. The dataset consists of over 50 columns with each one containing a different type of measurement, such as a reading from an accelerometer attached to a participant’s arm. The dataset also contains timestamp columns signifying the time of the measurement down to the microsecond, a text column containing the participant’s name, and a binary column signifying whether the measurement is the last of a repetition of the exercise. The target column consisting of 5 classes. The 5 possible classes are an exercise being completed properly, and 4 common user errors. 

My analysis consists of feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and fitting of Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and KNN models and their results. I hope you enjoy following along with my notebook.
